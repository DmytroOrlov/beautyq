# BeautyQ Current State and Handoff

Canonical handoff for new chats. Read this first, then see linked docs for deeper detail.

## 1. Current production `/beauty-search`

* `POST /beauty-search` is production-exposed by `LeaderboardPlugin` through `modules.apiBase[IO]` plus `BeautySearchRouteModules.apiElasticsearch`.
* `modules.apiBase[IO]` provides base/core non-Beauty APIs, `HttpServer`, `Ranks`, and old disabled Beauty inclusion helper bindings (not the active route gate).
* `BeautySearchRouteModules.apiElasticsearch` provides the ES-backed Beauty route.
* `modules.api[F]` is retained as rollback/legacy composition (`apiBase[F]` + `seedCatalogInMemory[F]`).
* Current exposed stack:

  ```text
  LeaderboardPlugin
  → modules.apiBase[IO] for base/core APIs
  → BeautySearchRouteModules.apiElasticsearch
  → BeautySearchRouteModules.seedCatalogElasticsearchPortConfigured
  → ElasticsearchClientModules.portConfigured
  → BeautySearchRouteModules.seedCatalogElasticsearch
  → BeautySearchCatalogBackendModules.seedResourceElasticsearch
  → BeautyQSeedLoader.ResourceLoader
  → BeautySearchReadyCatalogDocuments
  → ElasticsearchSeedIndexInitializer
  → ElasticsearchSearchBackend
  → BeautySearchService.Impl
  → BeautySearchApi
  ```

* Backend is seed-resource catalog snapshot + `ElasticsearchSearchBackend`.
* It is lexical/simple/catalog-first.
* `ElasticsearchPortCfg` is loaded from config section `"elasticsearch"`.
* It is not Qdrant, not hybrid.
* It is not fresh/repository-backed production catalog lifecycle.
* Route exposure exists; production-grade search lifecycle remains incomplete.
* `seedCatalogInMemory` remains available as rollback/non-default.

## 2. Current route behavior characterization

Documented as characterized, not as desired final contract:

* The public request contract is named `BeautySearchRequestContract`: `query` must be non-blank; `limit` must be within `1..BeautySearchRequestContract.MaxLimit` (`MinLimit` is `1`); optional latitude must be within `BeautySearchRequestContract.MinLatitude..BeautySearchRequestContract.MaxLatitude`; and optional longitude must be within `BeautySearchRequestContract.MinLongitude..BeautySearchRequestContract.MaxLongitude`.
* `BeautySearchRequestContract.MaxLimit` is source-backed by `BeautySearchSpecV1.spec.carouselSpec.variantSize`; API code, tests, and docs use the request-contract name as the public surface.
* Empty/whitespace-only queries, non-positive limits, limits above the carousel maximum, and out-of-range coordinates return structured JSON `400 BadRequest` failures with stable `code` and `message` fields before BeautySearch service or Elasticsearch calls.
* Malformed JSON / empty body / wrong limit type / missing required fields also use Tapir defaults and return `400 BadRequest` before BeautySearch service or Elasticsearch calls.
* Backend/query failures remain separate endpoint-domain failures and return `500 InternalServerError` with an empty body.
* Public `POST /beauty-search` request/response examples now live in [docs/codebase-review/04-api-and-http-contracts.md](codebase-review/04-api-and-http-contracts.md).
* The request contract is `BeautySearchRequestContract`. Semantic failures use structured JSON. Decode failures remain Tapir defaults.
* No maximum query length is enforced in this slice.
* Coordinates remain independently optional; the endpoint does not require a latitude/longitude pair.
* `BeautySearchReadyCatalogDocuments` rejects blank source / empty document list.
* BeautySearch public contract is now documented/frozen in `04-api-and-http-contracts.md`; the regression checklist lives in `06-tests-and-contracts.md`; no serving/backend behavior changed.

## 3. Search backend roles

* `ElasticsearchSearchBackend` is the current production lexical retrieval backend (seed-backed).
* `InMemorySearchBackend` is a rollback/regression/pure backend, not current production default.
* It is not an in-memory Elasticsearch.
* It must not be treated as ES scoring/order/analyzer oracle.
* Elasticsearch is the intended lexical retrieval baseline for text search, structured filters, facets, exact/range/geo constraints.
* Qdrant is semantic recall/complement candidate only.
* Product response assembly is projection over engine-native results.

## 4. Reached milestones

* **A**: non-production real-resource Qdrant/hybrid manual runner — reached.
* **A→B**: production-hybrid control-plane v0 — reached.
* **B1/B2**: production-hidden activation/handle + targeted control-plane module proof — reached.
* First B-lite pure `EngineEval` model — implemented.

## 5. Current priority: ES seed route stabilization

* Default production `/beauty-search` is now ES-backed over the seed catalog.
* ES seed-route checkpoint is reached. Plain `sbt test` is the canonical full verification command.
* Latest user-verified plain `sbt test` (Jun 13, 2026): 963 succeeded, 0 failed, 1 canceled.
* Business demo ready: runbook, query inventory, and smoke spec all in place.
* ES-native + Qdrant-native benchmark/eval comparison remains offline/eval-only.
* ES and Qdrant may advance together only in eval/benchmark, not serving.
* Production serving remains:

  ```text
  current ES seed route (default)
  → Qdrant shadow only if eval proves complement
  → controlled hybrid only after readiness/kill-switch/policy
  ```

* The production route does eager seed index preparation during route composition, but that is still not a production-grade ES lifecycle policy.
* `ElasticsearchSeedLifecycleMetadata` is a non-serving DI/readiness metadata seam exposed via `ElasticsearchSeedIndexReadiness.lifecycleMetadata` and `ElasticsearchSeedSearchComposition.lifecycleMetadata`; it is not a production lifecycle implementation.
* `ElasticsearchProductionReadinessState` is an internal non-serving state derived from that metadata. It records serving readiness `NotEnforced`, replacement `NotConfigured`, freshness `NotTracked`, refresh `EagerSeedPreparationOnly`, rollback `NotConfigured`, and operator visibility `NotExposed`.
* `ElasticsearchLifecycleStatusResponse` is a pure non-serving model/encoder derived from that state. It is not DI-bound or exposed through HTTP.
* `ElasticsearchStartupReadinessTransition` is a pure, unbound startup-preparation result model. Prepared transitions derive the same non-serving status response as direct readiness-state projection; failed transitions retain source-backed `QueryFailure.OperationFailure` details without lifecycle metadata or a status response. Both record `ElasticsearchStartupServingDecision.NotEnforced`; neither gates serving or changes preparation/composition behavior. Successful compositions now expose a prepared transition through `ElasticsearchSeedSearchComposition.startupReadinessTransition`, and `BeautySearchCatalogBackendModules.seedResourceElasticsearch` binds it through DI. Source-backed initializer failure paths are classifiable into `PreparationFailed` in pure tests without changing initializer behavior. No serving enforcement exists.
* `ElasticsearchStartupReadinessStatusResponse` is a pure non-serving startup status projection from `ElasticsearchStartupReadinessTransition`. Prepared projections include the nested `ElasticsearchLifecycleStatusResponse`; failed projections expose operation/message only, without lifecycle metadata or status response fields. It is not DI-bound or HTTP-exposed.
* Focused ES-backed route/module graph specs prove that lifecycle metadata and the derived readiness state are materialized through the current route graphs; production lifecycle remains incomplete.
* Current route-module state coverage documents the seed-only gaps; it does not enforce readiness or change serving behavior.
* The lifecycle status field shape and encoder are implemented as non-serving code and documented in `docs/codebase-review/ES_LIFECYCLE_STATUS_DESIGN.md`, but no endpoint, route path, HTTP status policy, or operator policy is implemented.
* Detailed milestone status and priority order for lifecycle/eval/shadow/hybrid work live in [docs/codebase-review/07-current-gaps-and-roadmap.md](codebase-review/07-current-gaps-and-roadmap.md).
* M6 Qdrant shadow readiness, M7 hybrid policy, and M8 controlled hybrid serving remain future roadmap work.
* `seedCatalogInMemory` remains available as rollback/non-default.
* Simulated hybrid is offline benchmark/eval only.

## 6. M-ESQ-EVAL

**M-ESQ-EVAL** = measured Elasticsearch-native + Qdrant-native evaluation comparison.

### Status

* This remains offline/eval-only.
* `roleDeltas:`, `queryDeltas:`, query-class classification, query-class sidecars, and `classDeltas:` are part of the current expanded checkpoint.
* Validated class-sidecar replay exists for `benchmark-small -> benchmark-large`.
* Saved aggregate JSON schema remains unchanged.
* `EngineEvalAggregateReport` remains unchanged.
* `EngineEvalReportJson` remains unchanged.
* Detailed contracts and evidence stay in [docs/codebase-review/06-tests-and-contracts.md](codebase-review/06-tests-and-contracts.md).
* Detailed milestone positioning stays in [docs/codebase-review/07-current-gaps-and-roadmap.md](codebase-review/07-current-gaps-and-roadmap.md).

### Boundaries

* This is offline/eval-only. The production `/beauty-search` route remains ES seed route.
* The route already performs eager seed index preparation during route composition, but that is not a production-grade ES lifecycle policy.
* `ElasticsearchSeedLifecycleMetadata` and `ElasticsearchProductionReadinessState` remain non-serving internal seams, not lifecycle completion.
* M6 Qdrant shadow readiness, M7 hybrid policy, and M8 controlled hybrid serving remain future roadmap work.
* No route switch, fallback, score fusion, reranking, HybridServe, or Qdrant auto-supplement from benchmark results.
* Benchmark output is decision support, not production automation.
* Qdrant/hybrid are non-production/manual/local/test boundaries, not production wiring.
* This is not production readiness and not routing approval.

## 6.5. Product search north star

Final direction:
Build useful free-string BeautyQ search that turns user text into domain-aware
product results by combining:

* DSL/spec-owned domain semantics for fast adaptation to new domains;
* Elasticsearch strengths for lexical precision, filters, facets, exact/range/geo
  constraints, analyzers, aggregations, and deterministic baseline retrieval;
* Qdrant strengths for semantic recall/complement on broad, conversational, and
  vague queries;
* explicit eval/benchmark reporting before any production hybrid or routing
  decision.

## 6.6. Forbidden paths

* No production hybrid.
* No route switch from benchmark alone.
* No Qdrant auto-supplement.
* No HybridServe from benchmark alone.
* No Qdrant-as-default.
* No startup indexing.
* No fallback.
* No score fusion/reranking.
* No production collection lifecycle manager / alias / blue-green.
* No production kill-switch integration yet.
* No freshness/reindex production policy yet.
* No public response schema changes unless explicitly requested.
* No forcing ES/Qdrant to mimic `InMemorySearchBackend` (rollback backend only).

## 8. Verification and testing protocol

* Use Constructive test taxonomy.
* Pure model/metric logic: `Contractual + Blackbox + Atomic`.
* In-process service/module seams: `Contractual + Blackbox + Group`.
* Real ES/Qdrant/Llama/Docker/HTTP: `Communication`, resource-backed auto-gated/cancelable (Qdrant uses distage-managed `QdrantPortCfg`; Llama defaults to local endpoints with optional env overrides; unavailable resources cancel with reason).
* Full `sbt test` is user responsibility unless explicitly delegated.
